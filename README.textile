Inline Aura displays aura information directly inside action buttons. It is heavily inspired from two addons writen by Tuller: OmniCC and the former Buff module of Dominos.

h2. Features

* color the button border depending on aura type and caster:
** buff cast by the player: green border,
** buff cast by other players: cyan border,
** debuff cast by the player: red border,
** debuff cast by other players: yellow border.
* use Blizzard animated glow for talent procs.
* display aura remaining time as a countdown inside the action button, Ã  la OmniCC or along the bottom side if OmniCC is used,
* display aura application time in the bottom-right corner,
* display additional useful information: holy power, soul shards, eclipse energy and combo points.
* mimics built-in target selection, taking into account spell type (helpful/harmfull) and self/focus key modifiers as well as the auto self cast setting.
* support macro targets, though it is restricted to "@target", "@player", "@pet", "@focus" and "@mouseover". For performance reasons, "@mouseover" support is disabled by default ; enable it if you really use it.

h2. Addon support

* support default Blizzard action bars, Dominos and any action bar addon using built-in Blizzard code.
* support Bartender4 and any action bar addon using LibActionButton-1.0.
* support (Lib)ButtonFacade.
* compatible with OmniCC, CooldownCount and tullaCC.

h2. Configuration

* graphical configuration through Blizzard addon options. Use "/inlineaura" to open it directly.
* optional spell specific configuration.
* helpful defaults for most classes ; if you don't like them, just disable the "InlineAura_Defaults" addon.

h3. Known issues and limitations

* Inline Aura does not work with non-standard action buttons, like those created by Macaroon.
* Inline Aura uses spell names instead of numerical spell IDs since not all Blizzard API works with spell IDs. Sometimes it may detect the wrong spell. 
* Inline Aura cannot display different (de)buffs with different settings (e.g. different highlight effect or text position) in the same button.
* Moreover all buttons use the same text position settings.
* Inline Aura may have issue with some ButtonFacade skins. This depends on the skins and there is no way to fix them in Inline Aura.

h2. Acknowledgements

I would like to thanks Tuller for the original idea and Avitus, Contrebasse, Gaff3, Moozhe, brotherhobbes and a lot of other people for testing and useful feedback.
